/**
 * Class representing the main status plug-in for the game.
 *
 * <p>This class extends {@link JavaPlugin} and acts as the main class for the
 * status plug-in in the game. By extending JavaPlugin, we have the capacity to
 * override certain methods to dictate the functionality of this plug-in. This
 * can include actions on enabling and disabling the plug-in, implementing
 * commands, interacting with events, and more.
 *
 * <p>The plug-in is responsible for handling player statuses, events associated
 * with status changes and refreshing game components when a status change occurs.
 *
 * <p>The {@code final} keyword ensures that this class cannot be subclassed.
 * This makes sense for a main plug-in class as there should only be one main
 * class for a plug-in.
